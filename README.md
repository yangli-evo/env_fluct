# Adaptive Walks in Fluctuating Environments

**Short desc.** Simulation and analysis of how environmental fluctuations reshape adaptive walks on machine-learningâ€“derived fitness landscapes (promoter/CRE), focusing on the timing of environment shifts vs. the number of mutational steps to reach local/global optima.

## Highlights
- **Question:** How do changing environments (fitness *seascapes*) alter the path length, detours, and endpoint of adaptive walks?
- **Approach:** ML-predicted regulatory landscapes (yeast promoters; human CREs) + SSWM adaptive-walk simulations across sequential environments.
- **Key readout:** Steps to peak, genetic distance vs. path length, detour frequency, and carryover of partial adaptation across environment switches.
